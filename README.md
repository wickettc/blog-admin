This is the admin page for my blog. Will be created with ReactJS

Live at: https://blog-admin-wickettc.vercel.app/

This is the page I can use to create and manage my blog posts and comments. Creating this site taught me how to
integrate PassportJS-JWT into a react app and how to pass JWT from client and server. This really showed me the power of JWT's and how it allows a RESTful API to be created independently of the front-end.
